#
# The "Wiggle Out" module has 2x speaker outputs, driven by
# the TI TAS5760 digital-input class D amplifier. Output power
# depends on speaker impedance and power supply voltage,
# typically 20-40 watts per channel.
#
# The TAS5760 has I2S audio and I2C control ports, which we
# can glue to the internal streams in the Wiggle Spine. The
# module's high speed synchronous data port is used as I2S
# data out, and the other necessary sync signals are derived
# from the outputCounter.
